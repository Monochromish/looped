# Info
TL;DR - I don't have a server and nothing is being stored on one. But I do make use of **anonymous** analytics in order to develop for each use case accordingly.  

Data reccived from School Loop is stored on device, implementing the `localStorage` API and browser cookies. This takes up to 5MB of space which can be cleared in the browser's settings. This allows the site to be lightweight/fast on any device and enables the use of service workers (if applicable) for offline functionality. Anonymous data is used for general anylitics used for development and improvement purposes, to evaluate the effectiveness of my interface, and to evaluate the level of use of various features.



School Loop's [Privacy Statement](https://www.schoolloop.com/privacy-statement) still applies.
