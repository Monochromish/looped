# Info


Data reccived from School Loop is store on device, implementing the `localStorage` API and browser cookies. This takes upto 5MB of space which can be cleared in the browser's settings. This allows the site to be lightweight/fast on any device and enables the use of service workers (if applicable) for offline functionality. Nothing is sent off to be processed exept data used for general anylitics used for development and improvement purposes, to evaluate the effectiveness of our interface, and to evaluate the level of use of various features.

TL;DR - I don't have a server and nothing is being stored on one. But I do make use of anonymous analytics in order to develop for each use case accordingly.  

School Loop's [Privacy Statement](https://www.schoolloop.com/privacy-statement) still applies.
